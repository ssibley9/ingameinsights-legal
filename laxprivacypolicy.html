        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

        <p>Lax Stats ("the App") is a lacrosse statistics tracking application developed by Steven Sibley ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</strong> All data created within the App — including team information, player names, game statistics, and settings — is stored locally on your device using Apple's on-device data storage framework.</p>

        <h2>Microphone and Speech Recognition</h2>
        <p>The App offers an optional voice control feature that uses your device's microphone and Apple's built-in Speech Recognition framework to allow hands-free stat tracking during games. When you use this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio is processed using Apple's on-device speech recognition where available.</li>
            <li>We do not record, store, or transmit any audio or voice data.</li>
            <li>Speech recognition is handled entirely by Apple's Speech framework and is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li>You can choose not to enable the microphone or speech recognition, and the App will function fully without it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All game data, team rosters, player statistics, season records, and app settings are stored exclusively on your device. If you delete the App, all associated data will be removed from your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The App includes an optional CSV export feature that allows you to share game and season statistics. This export is initiated entirely by you and uses your device's standard share functionality. We have no access to exported files.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not use any third-party SDKs that collect user data.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since all data remains on-device and no data is transmitted to us, the App is safe for use by individuals of all ages.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
