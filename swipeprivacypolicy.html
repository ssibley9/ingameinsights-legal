    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SWIPE ("the App") is a multiplayer card game developed by InGameInsights. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about the limited data we collect.</p>

    <p><strong>Anonymous Authentication:</strong> The App uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication to assign a temporary unique identifier to your device session. This identifier is not linked to your personal identity, email, or any account.</p>
    <p><strong>Game State Data:</strong> During gameplay, information about your cards, scores, and game actions is temporarily stored in Firebase Realtime Database to enable real-time multiplayer functionality. This data is associated with your game room only and is not used for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses Google Firebase for authentication and real-time game data. Firebase's privacy practices are governed by <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Game session data is temporary and is not retained after the game concludes. Anonymous authentication tokens may persist on your device until the app is uninstalled.</p>
